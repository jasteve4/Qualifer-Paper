Chip development in edge applications can take a significant amount of time to design and validate. In each new chip development cycle, there is a partial amount of intellectual property (IP) reuse and the addition of some new IP. New IP usually takes the form of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).  When introducing new IP into a system, the new IP can lead to bugs and extend the development cycle. The CHIPS (common heterogeneous integration and IP reuse strategies) project leverages the idea of IP reuse at the post die phase of the development cycle. Dies at this stage are considered to be chiplets, and each chiplet connects to an interposer and then connects to another chiplet. This method allows new IP to be developed separately from the old IP and reduces the development cycle needed to bring a new chip to market.
