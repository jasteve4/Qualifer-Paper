CHIPS is an architecture that aims to connect chiplets post-silicon through an interpose package. To connect chiplet and be able to control them in a heterogeneous system,  a host controller must be capable of adapting to any number of chiplets in a system. To meet this requirement, the host controller must be a general-purpose processor. RISC-V ISA is a free, and open ISA that supports several extensions, any of which can be used to communicate within a heterogeneous system.  The Rocket chip is the perfect general-purpose processor. It is maturity and has a large open-source community supporting it.
