\section{Conclusion}
The CHIPS project proposed the idea of integrating chiplets after fabrication. The methodology allowed the following chiplets to be connected post-fabrication: Rocket, LSTM, SCNN. Due to constraints in the area and time, only one chiplet has AIB wrapped around its IO. The Rocket chiplet is the idea choice because of its size and design maturity. The UCB taped out the rocket chip design sever time over the past few years\cite{AsanoviÄ‡:EECS-2016-17}. So, wrapping the Rocket chip is the least risky chiplet to wrap with AIB. Due to no interposer, AIB needs to connect through standard metal layers. All other chiplets use standard CMOS logic for its IO.

This paper forces on the idea of how to use the rocket chip in an SoC designed to be modular. It covers how the Rocket chip generator creates the Rocket chiplet and what modifications were made to integrate the Rocket chiplet into the CHIPS SoC. This paper details how to develop and run a high-level code for the CHIPS architecture.
