\section{Introduction}
The propose of the CHIPs project is to connect chiplets through two steps: design and fabricate chiplets that use a standard interface and then connect them through an interposer. There are three chiplets in this project: LSTM, SCNN, Rocket chip, all chiplets connect through a standard interface, AXI. This paper will detail the Rocket core chiplet and how it interacts with the CHIPs architecture.

This paper's sections are as follows. There are five-sections, not including this section. The second section covers the default chip generated by the UCB-BAR Rocket chip generator. The third-section, CHIPs architecture, details the CHIPs SOC and the chiplets.  The fourth section, Simulation environment, covers the simulation of the CHIPs architecture. The fifth-section, high-level software support, details the support software provided by the RISC-V foundation. The sixth section, results, discuss the results of the fabrication of the CHIPs project.
