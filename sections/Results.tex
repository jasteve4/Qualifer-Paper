\section{Results}
The Chips system was fabricated in the 55nm FUJISC process. Each chiplete was pushed through the place and route phase and than was connected together at the top level with the chip IO. The total die area was 100mm2. Figure ?? show the finished die before it was sent to foundry. Table ?? show the area and clock frequency of each chiplete and the chip as a whole.
