\section{High-level Software support}
The RISC-V foundation provides a GCC cross-compiler for targeting RISC-V ISA based computers. This compiler supports all the essential ISA extensions listed in the RISC-V specifications\cite{RISC-V-isa}. For this project, the GCC cross-compiler does not supports the following extensions: floating-point extension and custom-extension. Communicating with the bus controller requires the use of the E extension. Because the compiler does not implement this extension, a custom assembly library is needed to provide this functionality.  

The custom library provides support for the following instructions, bus read, and bus write. This instruction provides the primary method for communicating with the neural network accelerators.  In this project, the accelerators expose their functionality through memory-mapped registers. These registers represent two types of functionality: control and status. Control registers provide courses or fine-grain control of the accelerators, and the status register gives information on the state of the accelerator.
